ripples v0.1 (c) 2021 entropybound

sequencer based on envelopes given by interfering water droplet patterns

the pond has a common speed of sound: c = 1

droplets are circular waves, which can be given several attributes
- wavelength (distance between crests)
- shape (sinusoid by default, but also saw and triangle)

stones tend to sing, depending on the water level
- each stone gets a note, which plays a synth engine or over midi
