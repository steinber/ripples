ripples v0.3 (c) 2021 entropybound

sequencer based on envelopes given by interfering water droplet patterns

the pond has a common speed of sound: c = 5 squares pe second

droplets are circular waves, which can be given several attributes
- position in x and y
- inital time (a sort of phase)
- wavelength (distance between crests)
- shape (sinusoid by default, but eventually also saw and triangle)

stones tend to sing, depending on the water level
- each stone gets a note, which plays a synth engine (or eventually over midi)
